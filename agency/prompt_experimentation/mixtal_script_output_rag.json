        "question": "Can you provide examples of previously unreported patterns of splicing disruption identified in known cancer drivers using RegTools?",
        "rationale": "answer this question. First, we need to understand that RegTools is a tool for analyzing alternative splicing patterns in RNA-seq data. The question asks for examples of previously unreported patterns of splicing disruption identified in known cancer drivers using RegTools. Therefore, this question is related to the service that provides information about life sciences, specifically in the field of bioinformatics and genomics.",

"Intracoronary Injection of Epo After Myocardial Infarct ""Intra-CO-EpoMI""","What is the purpose of the study Intracoronary Injection of Epo After Myocardial Infarct ""Intra-CO-EpoMI""","Is intracoronary injection of a single dose of darbepoetin alpha, during reperfusion in patients hospitalized for ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), able to reduce infarct size ?

In in vivo studies, many experiments evidenced infarct size reduction, due to anti-apoptotic compounds, when given during reperfusion, after cardiac ischemia. In humans, post-conditioning offers such a protection, as the investigators have previously showed (Staat P et al. Post-conditioning the human heart. Circulation. 2005 112(14):2143-8).

Infarct size reduction could lead to a reduced rate of complications (heart failure, rhythmic complications) and finally, morbidity and even mortality. This protection depends on anti-apoptotic properties (Zhao ZQ et al. Inhibition of myocardial injury by ischemic postconditioning during reperfusion: comparison with ischemic preconditioning. Am J Physiology Heart Circ Physiology 2003 Aug; 285(2):H579-88). Many drugs have been proposed to be able to mimic this phenomenon. Among them, many are efficient but toxic in vivo or difficult to manage (insulin, morphin). One of the most promising agent could then be erythropoietin (EPO) (Opie LH et al. Postconditioning for protection of the infarcting heart. Lancet. 2006; 367(9509):456-8). In order to target ischemia-reperfusion injuries, EPO impact is better and better demonstrated (e.g.: Mudalagiri NR. Erythropoietin protects the human myocardium against hypoxia and reoxygenation injury via phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase and ERK1-2 activation. Br J Pharmacol. 2007 Oct 22). The purpose of the study is to test this hypothesis in humans, on the onset of the reperfusion, after myocardial ischemia (acute myocardial infarct). EPO could contribute to protect myocardium against ischemia-reperfusion injury. This impact could rely on anti-apoptotic properties.

ROsuvastatin Pretreatment to Reduce MyocArdial Periprocedural Necrosis:Comparison With Atorvastatin Reloading (ROMAIIReload),What is the purpose of the study ROsuvastatin Pretreatment to Reduce MyocArdial Periprocedural Necrosis:Comparison With Atorvastatin Reloading (ROMAIIReload),"An increase in cardiac biomarkers has been shown to occur in 5% to 30% of patients after otherwise successful percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs)(1) Apart from side-branch occlusion, intimal dissection and coronary spasm, a possible aetiology of myonecrosis after PCI might be distal embolization of atherogenic materials from plaque disruption,(2 )causing obstruction of blood flow at capillary level resulting in micro-infarction.(3,4 )Recent studies have suggested that pretreatment with Atorvastatin may be associated with a reduction in infarct size after elective PCI. (5-7 ). Actually the standard pretreatment in patients undergoing elective coronary-PCI and already treated with aspirin is clopidogrel loading dose administration before procedure.(8,9)The investigators compared a high (80mg) re-loading dose of Atorvastatin with a high loading dose of Rosuvastatin (40 mg) both administered within 24h before the procedure in reducing the rate of periprocedural MI. Therefore, the investigators will conduct a single center, prospective randomized study to assess whether a single, high (80mg) loading (within 24h)dose of Atorvastatin compared with a single loading dose of Rosuvastatin (20 mg) is effective in preventing elevation of biomarkers of MI after elective coronary stent implantation. We evaluate the incidence of MACCE(occurring of cardiac death, myocardial infarction (including periprocedural myonecrosis) and stroke at 30 days 6 and 12 month follow-up.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01228227?cond=heart%20attack&rank=13,Clicnical Trials
